## Reflection
Building this portfolio taught me how to combine **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to create a visually appealing and responsive website. I learned how to implement interactive elements such as a **mobile-friendly hamburger menu**, **glow effects**, and **animated skill bars**. Integrating **particles.js** for a dynamic background improved my understanding of JavaScript libraries and DOM manipulation.  
I also faced challenges with **responsive design**, ensuring the layout works across different screen sizes including mobile and tablet. Through this project, I improved my frontend development skills, gained practical experience in structuring a portfolio site, and learned how to deploy static websites using services like GitHub Pages and Netlify. Overall, it was a valuable experience in both design and coding.
